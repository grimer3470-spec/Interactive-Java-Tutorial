# Interactive-Java-Tutorial
This will be the beginning of a tutorial site for students and others who are intrested in doing Object Oriented Programming. I will also be doing a logic programming tutorial later, after I set up a organization page for tutorials after this. I should clarify that this tutorial is for people with some sort of experience on Java or those who don't mind being thrown in the deep-end.

Hello! Welcome to the first of many tutorials I will be doing. First off I'll be doing interactive tutorials mainly and I'll maybe record a voice over or a video to further explain if others need that, but for now We'll stick to learning via page.
First off I'll explain this tutorial mainly.
