# Interactive-Java-Tutorial
This will be the beginning of a tutorial site for students and others who are intrested in doing Object Oriented Programming. I will also be doing a logic programming tutorial later, after I set up a organization page for tutorials after this.

Hello! Welcome to the first of many tutorials I will be doing. First off I'll be doing interactive tutorials mainly and I'll maybe record a voice over or a video to further explain if others need that, but for now We'll stick to learning via page.
First off I'll explain this tutorial mainly. This specific tutorial is for making usre to clarify that grammar is very important in coding, because one misspelt word and the entire code stops working properly.
